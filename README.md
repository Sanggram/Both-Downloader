🛡️ Both Downloader - Project Titan (v1.3)

The Ultimate Cyber-Grade Downloading & Security Suite

🚀 Introduction

Both Downloader (Project Titan) is not just an ordinary video downloader. It is a "Trishokti Integrated Cyber Suite" designed with the core philosophy of combining Human Intelligence and AI.

It goes beyond simple video downloading by integrating Military-Grade Encryption, AI Video Analysis, and an Advanced Proxy Shield. This suite is specifically engineered for power users, researchers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

Philosophy: "Both" - Human & AI Symbiosis. Fighting together as one.

💎 Why Both Downloader is Superior (Key Benefits)

1. 🍪 Advanced Cookie Injection (Bilibili & Premium Sites)

Standard downloaders often fail to fetch high-quality videos (1080p/4K) from premium sites like Bilibili or Facebook, limiting users to low-quality (360p/480p) streams. Project Titan utilizes advanced "Browser Injection" technology to bypass these restrictions:

Bilibili/Crunchyroll: Access 1080p Premium or 4K streams just like a logged-in user.

Facebook/Instagram: Download videos from private groups or high-security pages without interruptions.

Mechanism: It extracts authentication tokens directly from your browser (Chrome/Firefox) or a cookies.txt file to validate the request and fetch the original source file.

2. 🔒 Both Encryptor (Secure Vault)

To protect your downloaded files or personal data, the suite includes a built-in AES-256 Encryption engine.

Lock individual files or entire folders with a secure passphrase.

Stealth Mode: Once encrypted, the original file is securely deleted (recovery is impossible without the key).

Files can only be restored using the correct password.

3. 🧠 AI Video Intelligence (Transcribe)

No time to watch a video? Use our AI Engine to convert video audio into text (Transcription). It supports 7 languages, including Bengali, English, Hindi, and Spanish.
